                <p id="my-info"> 
                    Working in a labor focused profession for the past decade most of which as a co-operator of a small business 
                    has given me the ability to meet deadlines, work with many companies and teams to accomplish one common goal, and understand 
                    what hard work means. This has pushed me to pursue a career in which I have always had a secret crush on as a developer, 
                    by joining a coding bootcamp. Attending a coding bootcamp has given me 
                    exposure to styling using CSS, and experience using javaScript.  I enjoy troubleshooting, and figuring out when, 
                    why, and how things work. I also enjoy learning and challenging myself. I would consider myself 
                    a hard worker who is willing to put in max effort and time on projects, whether by myself or in a group.
                    I am looking forward to earning a position with a company as a developer, paying my dues, and continuing to advance my knowledge within the field.
